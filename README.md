# System Programming Labs

## Lab 1: DataLab - Bit Manipulation
- **Objective:** 
  - Learn and practice bit-level operations in C.
  - Solve problems involving bitwise logic, masking, and shifting.
  - Understand how bit manipulation is used in low-level programming.

## Lab 2: Assembly Programming
- **Objective:** 
  - Write and debug simple assembly programs.
  - Understand CPU instructions, registers, and memory addressing.
  - Translate high-level language constructs into assembly.

## Lab 3: Basic Reverse Engineering
- **Objective:** 
  - Analyze simple compiled binaries to understand their behavior.
  - Use tools like `Ghidra`, `IDA`, or `Radare2` for disassembly and decompilation.
  - Identify functions, loops, and key logic in the binary.

## Lab 4: Reverse Engineering Techniques (Part 2)
- **Objective:** 
  - Dive deeper into reverse engineering techniques.
  - Analyze complex binaries with obfuscation or anti-debugging mechanisms.
  - Understand and bypass protections in compiled software.

## Lab 5: Exploiting Buffer Overflow (Part 1)
- **Objective:** 
  - Understand the fundamentals of buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
  - Identify and exploit buffer overflow in simple C programs.
  - Learn to use tools like `gdb` or `pwndbg` for debugging.

## Lab 6: Exploiting Buffer Overflow (Part 2)
- **Objective:** 
  - Explore advanced techniques for exploiting buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
  - Understand concepts like stack smashing, return address overwriting, and shellcode injection.
  - Bypass modern protections like ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization).
